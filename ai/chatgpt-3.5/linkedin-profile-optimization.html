                    I love nuanced ways of looking at the world and thinking outside the box. Philosophers were extraordinary thinkers. This led me to a BA in Philosophy.

                    Logic and analytical philosophy continued to suck me in. I wanted to apply this knowledge to the tech world. That's how I got into software development. During the learning process, I fell in love with my first programming language: Python. During my MA in Digital Humanities, it was fascinating how easy it was to learn the language and the gigantic applications it offered.
                    
                    I continue my education in different areas of software engineering nowadays. My specialties are: Fast learning of new skills, concepts and programming languages. I especially love C/C++, Java, Python, all about X-Technologies, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and Git/GitHub.
                    
                    Interesting areas in the IT field:
                    AI, BigData, IT-Security, Blockchain, IoT, XBRL Reporting

                    Please enhance my text above. It shoul dbe more appealing to software development roles
                    ChatGPT
                    
                    Absolutely! Here's a revised version of your text, tailored to appeal to software development roles:
                    
                    My journey began with a passion for philosophical inquiry, but it was the allure of logic and analytical thinking that drew me into the world of software development. Armed with a BA in Philosophy, I embarked on a quest to apply my intellectual rigor to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
                    
                    Python quickly became my gateway to this world, captivating me with its elegance and power. As I pursued my MA in Digital Humanities, I marveled at Python's versatility and its boundless potential in crafting innovative solutions.
                    
                    Since then, my appetite for knowledge has only grown. I thrive on the challenge of mastering new skills, concepts, and programming languages with lightning speed. From C/C++ to Java, from HTML/CSS to JavaScript, I embrace each new language and technology with fervor.
                    
                    But it's not just about the tools; it's about the possibilities they unlock. My interests span a wide array of cutting-edge fields, from AI and Big Data to IT Security, Blockchain, IoT, and XBRL Reporting. I see technology not just as a means to an end, but as a catalyst for transformative change.
                    
                    My passion extends beyond mere coding; it's about making a tangible impact in industries that matter. That's why I'm drawn to the intersection of technology and sectors like pharmaceuticals, MedTech, and FinTech. These industries represent the forefront of innovation, where every line of code has the potential to revolutionize how we work, live, and heal.
                    
                    As for location, I seek environments that foster creativity and collaboration. Whether it's the vibrant tech scene of New York and Florida, the burgeoning hubs of Dublin and London, or the precision-engineered landscape of Switzerland, I am eager to immerse myself in cultures that value innovation and excellence.
                    
                    In me, you'll find not just a software developer, but a relentless seeker of knowledge, a visionary thinker, and a passionate advocate for using technology to shape a better tomorrow. Let's create something extraordinary together.
